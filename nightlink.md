## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

Nighlink is a private order book based on the traditional finance's Dark Pools.
- A brief description of your project.

Nightlink aims to aid the movement of larger trades in the ecossystem by allowing them to avoid slippage. By making intentions private we can match up traders without massively affecting the market. Where slippage allows, this can allow large sellers to sell at a premium and also allow buyers to buy at a discount. 

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

The defi ecosystem in dotsama is constantly complaining about a lack of liquidity. With a low liquidity comes a high degree of slippage, this aims to help ease that. We also have ideas for seamless integration with existing DEXs through an easy to use widget.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

If something exists is the traditional finance world and not yet in the defi space then we are under the impression that it can be improved. Dark Pools are also not avaliable to the public in the traditional world, only to the rich elite and banks. Decentralising darkpools with allow the public to interact and benefit from this mechanism.

## Project Details

1. Mockups/designs of any UI components

The UI will be a simple swap like UI just to demonstrate the implementation.

2. Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

The callable surface for the end of the grant will be as follows: 

  Get Quote - Use the nightlink model to come up with a quote (scanlon can you describe this better)

  Place order - used to accept a quote when get quote is called.

  Claim profits - Token holders can earn the profits generated by the system (not the banks)

3. An overview of the technology stack to be used

We will be using the following technology:

  Substrate for the core node development.

  Occlum for the enclave development.

  React for the basic front end.

4. Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be 
deployed

5. PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

6. What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

7. This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious



Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1,5
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD
